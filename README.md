Introduction to Machine Learning - Supervised Learning

To execute the Jupiter Notebook we are expecting the data file to be in the same folder(My Drive/Colab Notebooks) as the Jupiter Notebook.
We will need Google Colab for this.
Go to Google Colab and save this notebook in your Google Colab.

Go to this link for downloading dataset for this Machine Learning project :

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/174/parkinsons

Download the parkinsons.data file and save it in this location:

My Drive/Colab Notebooks

I have also uploaded the dataset file in the github repository for quick reference.

After that you are good to go.
